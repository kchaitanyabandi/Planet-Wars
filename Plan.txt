General Strategy

1. Don't lose planets
2. Make ships faster than the enemy
3. Minimize enemy's ability to make ships
4. Minimize distance ships are sent 
5. Always do something (being passive isn't going to cut it)

Things I need to know

1. How much defense is required at each planet to not get taken?
2. How much ships do I have extra?
3. The cost/value of taking each planet?
4. Of the planets that I can take, what is the optimal way to take them?



How to value planets?
 break even turns? these are relative to each planet


Can I turn this into a Linear Program????
